# dot_printer

Just a simple little experiment with colored dots. It allows you to create images in the style of a dot matrix printer.

The following is an example of an image conversion using one of the scripts:

![image](./assets/test_image_04.jpg)
![image](./output/test_image_04.jpg)

It is very slow and crudely implemented.
